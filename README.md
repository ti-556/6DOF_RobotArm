# Robot-Arm-Kinematics-Simulations
Matlab and C++ implementations for robot arm kinematic computations.

<b>What the repository contains:</b>
- C++ code for inverse and forward kinematic calculations
  - C++ code for utlity functions (matrix operations and euler-rotation conversions)
- Matlab simulink model for inverse and forward kinematic simulations
- 3D CAD models of the robot arm for 3D printing
